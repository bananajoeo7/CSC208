## Solutions to Chapter 2.2:
2. (a) The sequence is increasing by 6 each time so the next term is 6.

2. (b) The formulat for the sequence is $a_n = 6n + 8$ because the sequence increases by six each time and starts at 8.

2. (c) You first find the 100th term, which is when $n = 99$, which equals $602$ then you add the first and the last term giving you $610$, then you multiply $610$ by half of the number of terms in the sequence giving you: $610 * 50 = 30500$.

$$
S(n) = 5 + 15 + 45 + ... + 5 * 3^20\\
-3S = 15 + 45 + ... + 5 * 3^20 + 5 * 3^21\\
-2S = 5 - 
$$
