## Solutions to Chapter 2.1:
Reaserch was conducted for the questions.
note: make sure you are looking at the common sequences sheet

1. (a) The answer is $a_n = n^2 + 1$ because if we subtract 1 from each term it ends up being the square numbers sequence.
1. (b) The answer is $a_n = (n(n+1))/2 - 1$ because this equation looks like the trianglular numbers sequence shifted by 1.
1. (c) The answer is $a_n = ((n+2)(n+3))/2 + 2$ because this equuation looks like its the triangular sequence that starts at 6 and its shifted 2 vertically.
1. (d) The answer is $a_n = (n+1)! - 1$ because if we add 1 its the factorial of numbers starting at 1 subtacted by one.
3. (a) 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
3. (b) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or $a_n = n$
3. (c) 0, 1, 2, 6, 24
6. They all add have the same equation just diffferent starting values for $a_0$ and $a_1$, the equation is $a_n = (a_a_-_2) + (n_a_-_1)$.
9. You would solve this by doing the following:
$$7a_n_-_1 - 10a_n_-_2 = 7(3*2^n^-^1 + 7*5^n^-^1) - 10 (3*2^n^-^2 + 7*5^n^-^2)$$
$$= 21*2^n^-^1 + 49*5^n^-^1 - (30*2^n^-^2 + 70*5^n^-^2)$$
$$= 21*2^n^-^1 + 49*5^n^-^1 - (15*2^n^-^1 + 14*5^n^-^1)$$
$$= 6*2^n^-^1 + 35*5^n^-^1$$
$$= 3*2^n + 7*5^n$$
13. (a) $\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2k$
13. (b) $\sum_{k=1}^{107} (1 + 4(k-1))$
13. (c) $\sum_{k=1}^{50} 1/k$
13. (d) $\prod_{k=1}^{n} 2k$
13. (e) $\prod_{k=1}^{100} k/(k+1)$

14. (a) $\sum_{k=1}^{100} (3 + 4k) = 7 + 11 + 15 + ... + 403$
14. (b) $\sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^k = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^n$
14. (c) $\sum_{k=2}^{50} 1/(k^2 - 1) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/8 + 1/15 + ... + 1/2499$
14. (d) $\prod_{k=1}^{n} k^2/(k^2 - 1) = 4/3*9/8*16/15*...*10000/9999$
14. (e) $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (2 + 3k) = 2*5*8*11*14*...*(2+3n)$
