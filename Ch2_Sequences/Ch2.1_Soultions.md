## Solutions to Chapter 2.1:
Reaserch was conducted for the questions.
note: make sure you are looking at the common sequences sheet

1. (a) The answer is $a_n = n^2 + 1$ because if we subtract 1 from each term it ends up being the square numbers sequence.
1. (b) The answer is $a_n = (n(n+1))/2 - 1$ because this equation looks like the trianglular numbers sequence shifted by 1.
1. (c) The answer is $a_n = ((n+2)(n+3))/2 + 2$ because this equuation looks like its the triangular sequence that starts at 6 and its shifted 2 vertically.
1. (d) The answer is $a_n = (n+1)! - 1$ because if we add 1 its the factorial of numbers starting at 1 subtacted by one.
3. (a) 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
3. (b) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or $a_n = n$
3. (c) 0, 1, 2, 6, 24
6. They all add have the same equation just diffferent starting values for $a_0$ and $a_1$, the equation is 

$a_n = (a_{n - 2}) + (n_{n - 1})$.

9. You would solve this by doing the following:\
$7a_{n - 1} - 10a_{n - 2} = 7((3)\times(2^{n - 1}) + (7)\times(5^{n - 1})) - 10 ((3)\times2^{n - 2} + (7)\times(5^{n - 2}))$

$= (21)\times(2^{n - 1}) + (49)\times(5^{n - 1}) - (30)\times(2^{n - 1}) + (70)\times(5^{n - 2})$

$= (21)\times(2^{n - 1}) + (49)\times(5^{n - 1}) - (15)\times(2^{n - 1}) + (14)\times(5^{n - 1})$

$= (6)\times(2^{n - 1}) + (35)\times(5^{n - 1})$

$= (3)\times(2^n) + (7)\times(5^n)$

13. (a) $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2k$

13. (b) $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{107} (1 + 4(k-1))$

13. (c) $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{50} 1/k$

13. (d) $$\displaystyle \prod_{k=1}^{n} 2k$

13. (e) $$\displaystyle \prod_{k=1}^{100} k/(k+1)$

14. (a) $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{100} (3 + 4k) = 7 + 11 + 15 + ... + 403$

14. (b) $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^k = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^n$

14. (c) $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=2}^{50} 1/(k^2 - 1) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/8 + 1/15 + ... + 1/2499$

14. (d) $\displaystyle \prod_{k=1}^{n} k^2/(k^2 - 1) = (4/3)\times(9/8)\times(16/15)\times...\times(10000/9999)$

14. (e) $$\displaystyle \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2 + 3k)$ $= (2)\times(5)\times(8)\times(11)\times(14)\times...\times(2+3n)$
