## Discrete Math Sequence Chapter 2.3:
### Polynomial sequences:
Polynomial sequences can be discovered in the differences of the functions, which will eventually lead you to finding a sequence with a $\Delta^k$ - constant.

The number of times you have to check the differences until the differnece is constant, will be the value of k.

#### Finite Differences:
The closed formula for a sequence will be a degree k polynomial if and only if the sequence is $\Delta^k$ -constant (i.e., the kth sequence of differences is constant).

For Example the following sequence:

$$
2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37, ...
$$

First set of differences:\
This shows us the polynomial degree is at least $\Delta^1$.

$$
1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ...
$$

Second set of differences:\
This shows us the polynomial degree is at least $\Delta^2$.

$$
3, 3, 3, 3, ...
$$

Now that all the differences are constant that tells us that the polynomial degree is $\Delta^2$.

## Note:
Recently the exercises have been super helpful in solving exercises, even though some are incorrect.\
