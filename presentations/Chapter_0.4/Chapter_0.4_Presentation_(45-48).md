## Surjections, Injections, and Bijections
### What is a Surjection:
#### Definition:
In mathematics, a surjective function, also known as a surjection, is a function of f such that, for every number/element y of the function's codomain, there exists at least one number/element x in the function's domain such that f(x) = y.

### What is a Injection:
#### Definition:
In mathematics, a injective function, also known as a injection, is a function of f such that, for every number/element x of the function's domain, there exists no more than one number/element y correspondingly in the function's codomain such that x<sub>1</sub> != x<sub>2</sub> and f(x<sub>1</sub>) != f(x<sub>2</sub>). Additionally this ensures that the inverse, f(y), is also a function.

### What is a Bijection:
#### Definition:
Some may think that injections and surjections are opposites, but be careful: “surjective” and “injective” are NOT opposites.In mathematics, a bijective function, also known as a bijection, is a function of f such that, it complies with both the criteria of a surjection and a injection.
