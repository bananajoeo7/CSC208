# Coloring
## Coloring in General:
Definition: Coloring refers to the assignment of labels/colors to the subject of constraint. <b>Vertex coloring</b> is a more commonly used 
type of coloring where each vertex has a color assigned to it, and no connected/adjacent vertices can have the same color (no vertices that 
have an edge between them). In graphing, there is something called a <b>clique</b> in a graph is a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent which is practically a size n is just a copy of the complete graph Kn. From this the <b>clique number</b> of a graph can be made which is the largest n for which the graph contains a clique of size n. The goal when coloring is often to find the <b>chromatic number</b>, which is the smallest amount of numbers to complete the coloring task, or the smallest clique number possible.

To talk about Brook's Theorem, a theory devised from this we go to (Johan Presentation)[Insert Johan Link Here].
