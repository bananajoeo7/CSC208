# Coloring
## Coloring in General:
Definition: Coloring refers to the assignment of labels/colors to the subject of constraint. <b>Vertex coloring</b> is a more commonly used 
type of coloring where each vertex has a color assigned to it, and no connected/adjacent vertices can have the same color (no vertices that 
have an edge between them). The goal when coloring is often to find the <b>chromatic number</b>, which is the smallest amount of numbers 
to complete the coloring task.
