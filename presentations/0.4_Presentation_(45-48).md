## Surjections, Injections, and Bijections
### What is a Surjection:
#### Definition:
In mathematics, a surjective function, also known as a surjection, is a function of f such that, for every number/element y of the function's codomain, there exists at least one number/element x in the function's domain such that f(x) = y.

### What is a Injection:
#### Definition:
In mathematics, a injective function, also known as a injection, is a function of f such that, for every number/element y or x of the function's codomain, there exists no more than one number/element x or y correspondingly in the function's domain such that x~1~ != x~2~ and f(x~1~) != f(x~2~).
