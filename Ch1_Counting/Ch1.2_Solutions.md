# Chapter 1.1 Solutions:
notes: alot of time spent this time was reasearching how to solve the few questions that I could. The book does not explain in the slightest bit how to solve these problems in the chapter. (WHY!!?!?!?)

1. (a) The answer to this equation should be $2^9$ because there are 6 values in the set.
$$2^6 = 64$$
1. (b) The answer is $2^3$ because we need to account for the remaining values in the set.
$$2^3 = 8$$
1. (c) We will raise 2 to the number of values that are odd which is 3 subtract that from |P(A)| which is $2^6$.
$$2^6 - 2^3 = 56$$
1. (d) ?
2. (a) That can be written as $(^6_4)$ which will equal 15.
$$(6!)/(4!(6-4)!) = 15$$
2. (b) That can be written as $(^3_1)$ which will equal 15.
$$(3!)/(1!(3-1)!) = 3$$
2. (c) That can be written as $(^6_4)$ which will equal 15, because any set with a cardinality of 4 has an odd number.
$$(6!)/(4!(6-4)!) = 15$$
2. (d) That can be written as $(^3_1)$ which will equal 15.
$$(3!)/(1!(3-1)!) = 3$$
3. Skip
4. Don't know how to solve.
5. Don't know how to solve.
6. Since a bit string can only have a 1 or a 0 you will find the cardinality of 6 1's then increase it all the way till 10 which is the number of bits and add them all together.
$$(10!)/(6!(10-6)!) + (10!)/(7!(10-7)!) + (10!)/(8!(10-8)) + (10!)/(9!(10-9)) + (10!)/(10!(10-10)!) = 386$$
