# How We Can Effectively Organize Our Study
## Concerns that have Arisen
- To much content was covered at once.
- Students aren't fully comprehending the exercises due to the manner the solutions are shown in the [textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html).
- Students arenâ€™t providing enough/coherent information on how to solve the exercises.
- The instructor doesn't have expert level of knowlege concerning the subject.
## Solution
#### Proposed Solutions to the Previous Concerns
- We should slow down the amount of content given at once. Depending on length of subchapters, 1-3 (usually 2) subchapters will be covered at at time.
- The main focus of the student conversations and presentations should be on the exercises and how to solve them in a way the students will comprehend.
- The new presentations should have clear and coherent solutions to the problems using information from and outside of the textbook.
- The might not be able to provide a proper math class structure, but should be able to fill in the gaps of a students presentation if another student is confused during the presentation.
### New Class Structure

| Syntax       | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------- ----------------  |
| Class Type 1 | Read 1-2 sub chapters.                  |
| Homework 1   | Each studendt is assigned 1-3 Exercises without solutions (can have hints) to create a presentation on. |
| Class Type 2 | Student present their questions to the class and will discuss the answers. |
| Repeat...    | Until entire chapter or sufficient content is complete. |
| Class Type 3 | Quiz if necessary on covered material. |

#### Notes:
##### Students will be graded on the following:
- Regular Git Repo commits for their presentations.
- The presentations in class to fellow students.
- Engagement during class discussions about the exercises.
- Quizzes if neccesary.
### Assignment
#### Requirements
- Presentation should be created in markdown.
- Presentation should provide an original response to the question.
- Presentation should use information inside the [textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html).
