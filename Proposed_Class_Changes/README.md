# How We Can Effectively Organize Our Study
## Concerns that have Arisen
- To much content was covered at once.
- Students aren't fully comprehending the exercises due to the manner the solutions are shown in the [textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html).
- Students arenâ€™t providing enough/coherent information on how to solve the exercises.
- The instructor doesn't have expert level of knowlege concerning the subject.
## Solution
#### Proposed Solutions to the Previous Concerns
- We should slow down the amount of content given at once. Depending on length of subchapters, 1-3 (usually 2) subchapters will be covered at at time.
- The main focus of the student conversations and presentations should be on the exercises and how to solve them in a way the students will comprehend.
- The new presentations should have clear and coherent solutions to the problems using information from and outside of the textbook.
- The might not be able to provide a proper math class structure, but should be able to fill in the gaps of a students presentation if another student is confused during the presentation.
### New Class Structure
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
### Assignment
#### Requirements
- Presentation should be created in markdown.
- Presentation should provide an original response to the question.
- Presentation should use information inside the [textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html)
